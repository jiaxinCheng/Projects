Everything about the first part of the project is in src and this part is in src2 file. To run the program, just use qmake in the "hwr" directory and everything will compile and run in the "hwr" directory. The Facile program is teared apart and merge into debugger and load.

Break button is used to add a break point if there is no breakpoint in the current line and remove breakpoint if there is a breakpoint. All breakpoints added will be in yellow background and the next line needed to be run will be in red foreground. 

The program will be reseted once it is ended, therefore, to see all the variable after one continue, a breakpoint should be added at the last line of the program. 

In the load window, press enter will be the same as clicking load. If nothing entered in the lineedit, there will be nothing happened. If the fil ename is wrong, a error message will appear and the error window can be hided by simply press "enter".

After the map of the variable is updated, press "inspect" in the debugger window or "update" in the inspect window will both update the varible in the inspect window.

Merge sort is in the msort directory, to run the test, compile the main.cpp program. and the program will run. there are two tests in the main test file, one of them is a sorting of a vector of strings and the other is a vector of pairs of <string, int>.
