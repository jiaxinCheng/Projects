in order to compile the hw3q5, just do "make hw3q5" and the program will compile and can be ran in the current directory. In order to clean, do "make cleanhw". 
if want to do the test for llistint, then type " make tests" and clean the files by typing "make cleantests"
hw3.txt is the problem 2
problem 3 is the llistint.h llistint.cpp test.cpp 
problem 4 is the stackint.h stackint.cpp 
problem 5 is the hw3q5.cpp

after the compiling, stakcint.o and llistint.o will be created in the "bin" directory.
